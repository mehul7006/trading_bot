## 🔧 **TECHNICAL DEBT & ISSUES**

### **High Priority Issues** 🚨

1. **Java Compilation Errors**
   ```
   Error: Could not find or load main class WorkingTradingBot
   Caused by: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError
   ```
   - **Impact**: Java bots non-functional
   - **Fix Required**: Immediate classpath and packaging fixes

2. **Inconsistent Data Sources**
   - **Issue**: Multiple APIs (Upstox, Yahoo Finance, simulated data)
   - **Problem**: Different data sources give different results
   - **Solution**: Standardize on one reliable source

3. **Accuracy Measurement Confusion**
   - **Problem**: Mixing confidence scores with actual accuracy
   - **Issue**: "85% confidence" ≠ "85% accuracy"
   - **Fix**: Implement proper backtesting with real P&L

### **Medium Priority Issues** ⚠️

1. **Code Duplication**: 70% of functionality repeated across bots
2. **Documentation Gaps**: Many advanced features undocumented
3. **Testing Inconsistency**: Different test methodologies across implementations
